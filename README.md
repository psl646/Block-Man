# BlockMan

BlockMan is a JavaScript browser game where your goal is to reach the exit as quickly as you can.  But wait, BlockMan can NOT jump and typically these exits are on a different level.  You must use blocks provided to you in the level to create a path to the exit!

## MVP

- A sprite representing BlockMan
- Blocks that BlockMan can manipulate
- A timer on the screen to show how much time has passed.
- At least one level

## Phase 1

- Deal with block collision
- Blocks can be pushed or picked up
- Logic for lifting/pushing blocks
- Logic for BlockMan's pathing - can only go up if it is only one level up.

## Phase 2

- Rendering the game using canvas

## Phase 3

- Timer
- Welcome screen
- Maybe a key to zoom out to get a birds eye view of the game to plan ahead
